# EthereumStats

By fcepeda and syerbes.

Description:

This is a project to track transactions in Ethereum's blockchain, generating an output graph with the corresponding nodes after applying a function (like centrality). 

There are set paths in the code that should be changed/created to match the host pc requirements.

We use the public chain downloaded locally, accessing it via web3 through IPC. The IPC access mechanism can be easily modified to another one (like a REST API), although it
can degrade performance.
